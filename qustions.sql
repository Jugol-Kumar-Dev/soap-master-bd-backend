The resulting hyperthyroidism manifestations include heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhea, hyper-reflexia, tachycardia, and palpitations. Graves\' disease is also associated with autoimmune disorders such as pernicious anemia, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes, among others, which suggests an autoimmune source of hyperthyroidism. TSH levels are decreased in these patients due to hypothalamic/pituitary feedback inhibition.The initial diagnostic test is a thyroid function panel followed by radionucleotide uptake scans if the diagnosis remains unclear.

Graves\' disease is also associated with autoimmune disorders such as pernicious anemia, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes, among others, which suggests an autoimmune source of hyperthyroidism. TSH levels are decreased in these patients due to hypothalamic/pituitary feedback inhibition.The initial diagnostic test is a thyroid function panel followed by radionucleotide uptake scans if the diagnosis remains unclear.

It is imperative that beta-hCG with transvaginal ultrasound is performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy in women of child-bearing age.Ectopic pregnancy is defined as an extrauterine pregnancy. The majority of cases occur at the fallopian tube (96%); other sites include cervical, interstitial, ovarian, intramural, or abdominal. It commonly presents with first-trimester vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and possible pregnancy discomforts (e.g., breast tenderness, frequent urination, or nausea).

Poor glycemic control increases the risk of a neural tube defect in the fetus.Infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at increased risk of many congenital malformations as well as postnatal complications. These risks are more likely if there is poor maternal glycemic control, especially in the periconceptional period. For this patient with an extremely high A1c (an indicator of glycemic control over the last 3 months), and a gestational age of around 8 weeks, the risks to her fetus are significant. Furthermore, the presence of microalbuminuria on urinalysis indicates a developing diabetic nephropathy and confirms that she has had long-standing poor glycemic control. The most common anomalies in IDM are cardiovascular defects such as septal defects and transposition of the great arteries as well as neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. This patient’s fetus is also at risk for prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction (especially since this mother has T1DM with microvascular complications) or macrosomia, and miscarriage. Risk is minimized by tight glycemic control with an aggressive insulin regimen throughout pregnancy.Incorrect Answers:Answer 1: Aneuoploidy risk is not increased in IDM, and this patient is at baseline risk since she is below the “advanced maternal age” cutoff of 35 years. Of note, some of the values used in second trimester screening (maternal serum alpha­fetoprotein, estriol, and inhibin A) are generally lower in women with diabetes. Guidelines specific to this patient population should be used for the aneuploidy screen so as to avoid false positives.Answer 2: Post-term delivery occurs after 42 weeks gestation. Maternal diabetes typically causes prematurity. Post-term delivery is associated with fetal malnutrition, hypoxemia, and oligohydramnios due to suboptimal functioning of the placenta, and the risk of meconium aspiration increases as the gestation continues. Induction of labor is generally performed at 42 weeks to avoid these complications.Answer 4: Neonatal hyperglycemia is not seen in IDM, but hypoglycemia is. This is due to crossing of glucose from the mother to the fetus via the placenta, and subsequent hyperinsulinemia and ß-cell hyperplasia from the fetus. After delivery, the high insulin levels cause hypoglycemia because there is no longer an overabundant source of glucose. Hyperglycemia in infants is much less common and can be due to glucose infusion or neonatal sepsis.Answer 5: Oligohydramnios is not specifically associated with maternal hyperglycemia, but polyhydramnios is. The mechanism for increased amniotic fluid is unclear, though some speculate that fetal hyperglycemia results in polyuria and thus polyhydramnios.

Right lower abdominal pain in a female can be due to a variety of causes including endometriosis, ovarian torsion, appendicitis, and nephrolithiasis, but the positive pregnancy test and history of chlamydia should raise suspicion for ectopic pregnancy. In ectopic pregnancy, the embryo implants outside of the uterus. TVUS is used to evaluate whether an intrauterine sac is present. An intrauterine sac can be visualized with TVUS by 5-6 weeks of gestation. An empty uterus in the setting of a positive pregnancy test is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. In addition, TVUS can evaluate for presence of a gestational sac at an ectopic site, and for evidence of rupture, which presents as free fluid in the abdomen or pelvic cul-de-sac.Incorrect Answers:Answer 1: Transabdominal ultrasound is less sensitive than transvaginal ultrasound for detecting intrauterine pregnancy.

The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is made with pregnancy testing and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS).In this vignette, the patient\'s presentation of vaginal bleeding, unilateral lower abdominal pain, and adnexal tenderness is highly suspicious for ectopic pregnancy. Right lower abdominal pain in a female can be due to a variety of causes including endometriosis, ovarian torsion, appendicitis, and nephrolithiasis, but the positive pregnancy test and history of chlamydia should raise suspicion for ectopic pregnancy. In ectopic pregnancy, the embryo implants outside of the uterus. TVUS is used to evaluate whether an intrauterine sac is present. An intrauterine sac can be visualized with TVUS by 5-6 weeks of gestation. An empty uterus in the setting of a positive pregnancy test is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. In addition, TVUS can evaluate for presence of a gestational sac at an ectopic site, and for evidence of rupture, which presents as free fluid in the abdomen or pelvic cul-de-sac.Incorrect Answers:Answer 1: Transabdominal ultrasound is less sensitive than transvaginal ultrasound for detecting intrauterine pregnancy.

The appropriate treatment is dependent upon the side effects of the drug. Oral contraceptive pills and oral progesterone therapy can be used for menorrhagia and will regulate the menstrual cycle; however, they are contraindicated in patients with hypercoagulable states such as a history of deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, or hereditary conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or factor V Leiden.
